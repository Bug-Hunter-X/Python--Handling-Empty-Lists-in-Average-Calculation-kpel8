# Python Bug: ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python code: a `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when calculating the average of an empty list. The code contains a function, `calculate_average`, which calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, if the input list is empty, the code attempts to divide by zero, causing a runtime error. The solution provided handles this edge case gracefully, preventing the error.
